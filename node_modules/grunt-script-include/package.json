  "readme": "grunt-script-include\n===\n\n> Include script files individually for debugging.\n> An alternative to source maps, especially useful for browsers that don't support them.\n\n\n\n## Getting Started\nThis plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.0`\n\nIf you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:\n\n```shell\nnpm install grunt-script-include --save-dev\n```\n\nOnce the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:\n\n```js\ngrunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-script-include');\n```\n\n*This plugin was designed to work with Grunt 0.4.x. If you're still using grunt v0.3.x it's strongly recommended that [you upgrade](http://gruntjs.com/upgrading-from-0.3-to-0.4), but in case you can't please use [v0.3.2](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-copy/tree/grunt-0.3-stable).*\n\n\n\n## Include task\n_Run this task with the `grunt include` command._\n\nTask targets, files and options may be specified according to the grunt [Configuring tasks](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks) guide.\n### Options\n\n#### include\nType: `String`\n\nThis option is a required option which specifies the full path to create your `<script>` tags in.\n\n#### attributes\nType: `String`\n\nThis option specifies any space separated attributes to use on your `<script>` tags.  Defaults to ''.\n\n### Usage Examples\n\n```js\ninclude: {\n    dev: {\n        options: {\n            include: 'build/include/scripts.html'\n        },\n        files: [{\n            expand: true,\n            cwd: 'src/scripts',\n            src: ['vendor/**/*.js', 'app/**/*.js'],\n            dest: 'build/js/src/'\n        }]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis task supports all the file mapping format Grunt supports. Please read [Globbing patterns][http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#globbing-patterns] and [Building the files object dynamically][http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks#building-the-files-object-dynamically] for additional details.\n\nIf the files do not exist in the destination specified they will be copied there.\nThe root is automatically calculated based on the `include` option and `files.dest`.\n\n\n## Release History\n\n * 2013-08-08   v0.0.1   Initial release\n\n---\n",
